"""Combined gfx1250 asm-kernel perf bench.

Imports the top-level @benchmark sweep fns from the aiter op_tests (which the
aiter-op-test skill keeps importable for exactly this kind of combination
testing) and runs each over its own shape axes.

Output discipline: this script prints ONLY the per-op summary tables. All the
underlying noise (per-config "calling ..." logs, JIT build output, aiter import
banners, pandas/torch/ROCTracer warnings, including C-level fd writes) is
silenced via os-level fd redirection while the kernels run; the markdown tables
are then printed to real stdout.

Run from the aiter repo root so `op_tests/` siblings import cleanly:

Environment
-----------

One variable, applied to every op that sweeps a token count:

    AITER_BENCH_TOKENS=1,128,512 python op_tests/bench_gfx1250_combo.py --dsv4

Leave it unset and every op runs the default in this file, which is the tested
configuration -- the shapes below are what the suites are expected to pass on.
Set it and it wins everywhere, with no second-guessing: an explicit request is
the caller's to make, including for shapes an op is known to fail.

The defaults are not one list, because a single token count does not mean the
same thing to every op:

    mla_v4_decode   1..1024. Decode carries one token per sequence, so the
                    axis is really the batch, and 65536 is not a shape the
                    model runs.
    inverse_rope    1..16384. The axis is -s at a fixed -b 128,16, and 65536
                    faults -- in the triton reference the UT compares against,
                    not in the kernel under test.
    mega_moe        1..2048. 65536 cannot allocate its symmetric arena; see
                    _MEGA_MOE_TOKENS.
    a8w8_blockscale 1024..65536. Below 1024 it walks into a UT bug; see the
                    note in DSV4_OPS.
    mla_v4_prefill  1024..16384, the DSv4 prefill chunk. 65536 faults; see
                    _MLA_PREFILL_TOKENS.

With the variable unset, the child-UT ops (score_qk, a8w8_blockscale) pass no
shape flag at all, so each UT sweeps the range its owner maintains. The
in-process ops (moe, a16w16, mha, mla_v4_prefill) iterate shapes here and take
their default from the module.

Other variables:

    ENABLE_CK=0                        set before importing aiter; the module
                                       already setdefault()s it.
    GPU_ARCHS / CU_NUM                 detected once here and exported to every
                                       child, so no child runs rocminfo. Four
                                       ranks starting at once contend for
                                       rocminfo's rocm_smi mutex and a rank can
                                       lose it outright -- see _pin_arch. Set
                                       either yourself and yours wins.

mega_moe at tokens/rank=65536 fails in setup(), asking 7.5 GB for cco's VMM
arena against a 4 GiB default. MORI_SHMEM_HEAP_SIZE does not reach that arena
(see run_mega_moe), so exporting it changes nothing -- and exporting it
sweep-wide takes the machine down, because that heap is preallocated per rank
for every case. The tier is out of the sweep; fixing it means passing
per_rank_vmm at Communicator.init().

Failures do not stop the sweep: a case that aborts is recorded and the run
moves to the next one, with a "N failed, M ops selected" list at the end and a
non-zero exit code. A GPU fault inside this process is the exception -- it
takes the interpreter down and no handler runs, which is why the child-UT ops
are the ones that survive their own crashes.

``--ops`` accepts any op, including one held out of a suite's defaults because
it is broken on the current arch, so it can be re-checked on a newer image.

The ``mori_ep`` op runs the EPv2 benchmark from ``${MORI:-/app/mori}`` as the
image provides it -- this script never updates or installs mori. Environment
variables select backend, token tiers, eager/graph modes, EP size, dispatch
dtype, and correctness checking:

    TOKENS=512 MODES=graph \
      python op_tests/bench_gfx1250_combo.py --dsv4 --ops mori_ep

It sweeps two dispatch wires by default, bf16 and fp4, one child process each
(bench_ep.py reads $DISP at import). fp4 is the wire DSv4 serves on; bf16 is
the reference. $DISP overrides, comma-separated -- DISP=fp8 or DISP=bf16,fp8,fp4.
Note that mori disables its own correctness check on fp4, so those rows are
unchecked rather than verified; the table label says so.

The ``mhc`` op runs:

    python3 op_tests/test_mhc.py -n 7168 -m 512 --fuse_rmsnorm

The ``qk_norm`` op runs both DSv4 phases:

    python3 op_tests/test_flydsl_qk_norm_rope_quant.py \
      -T 16384 --H 128 --D 512 --RD 64 --no-quant --qweight

    python3 op_tests/test_flydsl_qk_norm_rope_quant.py \
      -T 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 --H 128 --D 512 --RD 64 --no-quant --qweight

The ``score_qk`` op runs two decode KV lengths at batch 512:

    python3 op_tests/op_benchmarks/triton/bench_deepgemm_attention.py \
      --batch 512 --heads 64 --index_dim 128 -kv_length 384 -mtp 0 \
      --kv_preshuffle --blocksize 64

    python3 op_tests/op_benchmarks/triton/bench_deepgemm_attention.py \
      --batch 512 --heads 64 --index_dim 128 -kv_length 10240 -mtp 0 \
      --kv_preshuffle --blocksize 64

score-QK is a decode op, so its KV length is the average context one decode
step scans -- input + output/2 -- after CSA's 4x KV compression:

    1K in / 1K out   -> (1024  + 512)  / 4 =   384
    16K in / 4K out  -> (16384 + 2048) / 4 =  4608
    32K in / 16K out -> (32768 + 8192) / 4 = 10240

The DSv4 ``mla_v4_decode`` op runs sparse decode with GQA/H=128, batch=512 and
q_seq=1 (M=512), sweeping KV lengths 256/512/1024 and split counts 1/2/4.

The DSv4 ``mla_v4_prefill`` op runs eight performance cases at H=128 and
D=512: compressed prefix-pool rows 4096/16384, crossed with dense/sparse CSR
modes, crossed with fp8/bf16. The current chunk remains uncompressed:

    python3 op_tests/test_pa_sparse_prefill.py \
      -n <token sweep> --h_q 128 -d 512 \
      --total_pages 4096 16384 --total_tokens <token sweep> \
      --prec fp8 bf16 --mode dense sparse --no-verify

The UT compares the backends it has for each precision -- opus and asm on fp8,
opus and triton on bf16 -- so one run covers both precisions and all three
backends. There is no nnz axis to sweep: the CSR is generated from --mode
(sparse draws a random nnz per row, dense fills every row) under --seed, so
nnz is an outcome, not an input.

The ``inverse_rope`` op runs the tp1 attention-output shape (-b is
(n_local_heads, n_local_groups); 128,16 is V4-Pro at dp/tp1):

    python3 op_tests/test_inverse_rope_group_quant.py \
      -b 128,16 -s <token sweep> -l n32k4 --group-size 32

The ``a8w8_blockscale`` op runs:

    python3 op_tests/test_gemm_a8w8_blockscale.py \
      -m 512 \
      -nk 2048,7168 7168,16384 6144,7168 \
          7168,3072 65536,1536 8192,1536 \
      --ck_preshuffle True --flydsl

The ``a16w16`` op uses ``test_opus_a16w16_gemm.py`` with batch=1, M=512,
K=7168 and N=64,384,1024,2048,32320,129280.

The ``mega_moe`` op runs both sides of the comparison:

    MORI_V2_KERNEL_BACKEND=hip MEGA_DISPATCH=mori \
    torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 \
      op_tests/multigpu_tests/test_mega_moe_gfx1250.py \
      -e 384 -k 6 -hd 7168 -id 3072 \
      --layers 61 -tpr 512 --combine scatter_fused \
      --acc_verify 0 --profile_table 1

    MORI_V2_KERNEL_BACKEND=hip MEGA_DISPATCH=mori \
    torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 \
      op_tests/multigpu_tests/test_mega_moe_gfx1250.py \
      -e 384 -k 6 -hd 7168 -id 3072 \
      --layers 61 -tpr 512 --combine gather \
      --acc_verify 0 --profile_table 1

Token sweeps come from one variable, AITER_BENCH_TOKENS (see Environment
above). Unset, each op runs its own default -- the ops do not share a supported
range, so those defaults differ and each says why at its constant. Set, it
applies to every op that sweeps tokens, and the file does not argue with it.

``a16w16`` is not one of them: its range is a function of what opus has tuned,
not a fixed limit. Shapes with no tuned winner fall back to a split-K kid whose
launcher is 32-bit gmem-descriptor bound, which is both slow and, at M=65536,
wrong. Re-tuning through csrc/gemm_a16w16/gemm_a16w16_tune.py --libtype opus is
what widens the range, so the bench predicts nothing and reports what it gets.

gfx1250's bundled CK does not compile, so the asm JIT modules must be built with
ENABLE_CK=0. The script sets it (before importing aiter) so a plain run just
works; an explicit env override still wins.

    # added it to cover its own "honor strided x_scale" fix and gated it on
    # `if ck_preshuffle:` alone.
    #
    # Too wide a gate. The fp32 blockscale path does probe stride(0) != 1 to
    # learn the layout, so strided coverage means something there. The mxfp8_128
    # path this op runs (--flydsl --ck_preshuffle) does not: it declares the
    # layout with is_x_scale_transposed=True and never reads the stride
    # (gemm_op_a8w8.py:978-985 states the contract -- x_scale bytes are
    # column-major (K//128, M) inside a contiguous (M, K//128) tensor). So the
    # strided tensor exercises nothing real here; it only hands triton a
    # stride != 1 specialization that dies in make_llir.
    #
    # A/B 20260828, that line the only variable. The matrix is 162 cases: the
    # UT's 27-value default -m, times this op's six (n,k), M outer. As written
    # the sweep dies on case 2 (M=2, padded onto the M=16 row); with
    # .view(*x_scale.shape) it reaches case 160 -- so every M through 8192,
    # M=16 and M=64 among them. Those are exactly the M #4773's rows cover, so
    # the gluon kernel compiles and runs once the layout is right. (Case count
    # is derived from where the fault lands, not from a per-case log: _run_child
    # keeps only the last 30 lines, and a GPU fault is fatal, so reaching M's
    # 27th value is itself the proof the first 26 completed.)
    #
    # The patched sweep still ends in a GPU fault at its last M, but that is a
    # separate, older story: m=10240 n=7168 k=3072 run alone passes at err=0,
    # 1220 TFLOPS, split-K checks included. Same shape as a fresh process, so
    # state carried across cases -- see the f4gemm note above.
    #
    # The fix is upstream's call: that gate wants to be `ck_preshuffle and not
    # use_flydsl_fp8_scale`, matching how the asm/triton block below already
    # excludes this path. Narrowing the gate is the right shape of fix, not
    # rewriting the line as .view() -- the two calls differ only in stride, so
    # .view() would collapse them and drop coverage of the is_x_scale_tranposed
    # == False branch that #4406 added the line for. Evidence either way:
    # -m 16 -nk 2048,7168 --ck_preshuffle True passes the strided check with
    # the line untouched, and only adding --flydsl makes it crash.
    #
    # Back in the sweep because _A8W8_BLOCKSCALE_TOKENS now starts at 1024,
    # which keeps every shape clear of the M that reach those rows. Verified on
    # 20260828, rocm/fw-bringup:gfx1250-atom--20260827-ubench: 36/36 cases,
    # err=0 on all, 2207-7003 TFLOPS. That run also clears M=10240, the shape
